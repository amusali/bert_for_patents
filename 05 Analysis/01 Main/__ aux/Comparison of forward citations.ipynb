A novel electrolytic cell that incorporates the subject electrolyte also is provided.

An object inherits (derives) properties and methods from other (parent) objects via its visual containership. In this manner, the task of creating and maintaining application programs is greatly simplified. An alternative embodiment providing an \"Object Explorer\" is also described. The Explorer collapses object inspector and object tree functionality into a single UI (user interface) element. This allows the user to avoid switching back and forth between an inspector/property sheet user interface element on the one hand and an object tree user interface element on the other. Additionally, the imporved interface consumes less screen surface area.\n",

      "A method, a mobile system, and a home network base station are disclosed. A mobility management entity 502 may receive a notification of a connection attempt by a mobile system 104. The mobility management entity 502 may generate a network access message element 650 having a bearer protocol parameter. The mobility management entity 502 may send the network access message element 650 to the mobile system 104 via a home network base station 110. The mobile system 104 may use the bearer protocol parameter to establish packet data network connectivity with a home network 108 associated with the home network base station 110. The mobile system 104 may determine a traffic bearer for a data traffic set based on the bearer protocol parameter.\n",

The mobile management entity 502 may send the local network access disable notification message element 650 to the mobile system 104 upon an imminent local network access loss event.\n",
      "A dispersion correction circuit is provided for use with an input driving signal. The dispersion correction circuit includes an input portion, an output portion and a filter portion. The input portion is arranged to receive the input driving signal. The output portion can output an output signal based on the input driving signal. The filter portion is disposed between the input portion and the output portion. The filter portion includes a varactor, a DC bias portion, and a transformer. The DC bias portion provides a DC bias to the varactor.\n",
